    Do you dream of financial independence and freedom? Don't just dream. Start to create something. Start small, test it, change a bit if needed and test again. A small side project could be and probably should be the beginning of the thing. Work on it if it grows. Drop it if not and try something new. Technology can help sometimes. A simple web app could be that small side project. Facebook started that way. Then it evolved.
  </p>

  <p>
    Simple web apps use common components or modules usually. Landing page, log-in, payment, newsletter, etc. These parts don't require rocket science and can be developed by mediocre developer pretty fast. The thing that really differs between apps is the core idea. It doesn't have to be very hard to build that part too. It all depends of course but not every project should be very complex or complicated at the beginning. In fact, it shouldn't. You don't have to pay a big salary for senior software engineer when your project can be built by a mediocre developer. It's not that easy to find senior developer ready to work even when you pay much. You don't have to hire a software agency for your project. They're great and they can build anything for you, that's for sure. But are you sure your project is worth it? Are you convinced by your clients to spend a lot of money to build the project?
  </p>

  <p>
    Start small, spend as little as possible, test. What if your idea doesnâ€™t catch up at first. You should be prepared for it. It's better to spend 1000 USD and two months than 25000 USD and 10 months to get to know the project is not another big thing. Spend as little as possible and test as fast as possible. Don't spend too much time and money on something people don't want. Create something simple and ship it to check whether someone like it. It doesn't have to be that hard to build simple web app once you know how to code. It's a useful skill that can help you make your ideas come true. That's why I learn to programme. I know how to code and how to ship simple web apps. I'm not the best programmer. I don't build big complex software solutions for big companies. I just know how to code and ship simple web apps for simple ideas. Sometimes it's enough. A simple web app can be just enough to find out what clients think about it. What is the most important thing for you? Your project or who built it? Do your clients ask for it?
  </p>

  <p>
    Many can write code, but do they care about your project after they ship it? I believe projects evolve, require some changes or need a pivot. They live with users and because of them.
    I'm not an expert. I want to learn. I want to know how to make software that people love to use. Learning it with you would be better, than learning it alone. I'll be happy when you succeed because I will learn from you how. I try to find the way along with you. I do my side projects but they don't guarantee anything. Maybe yours will be that thing then I could adapt my ideas. We can read YC stuff and case studies but what's real is real. I wish you find your clients, I want to help you with that. Creating something meaningful is great fun and pleasure. It brings excitement and adrenaline. Learning it with you could be a great adventure. Why so much effort? Isn't it just acting? Acting would be exhausting. I really want to know how to make apps people will love, how to find clients and convince them. It's not just about money. It can't be just about money. Learning how to do the startup thing has no price. Creating long-term relation has no price. I give not just my time and skills. You give not just money. It's far more important.

  <p>
    Let's talk about your idea. What is it? Isn't it too complex or the target isn't too wide? Do you know how you tell your clients about your project? What is the smallest thing we can build fast and test it as soon as possible? Do you really, really need the thing you want to build or you just want to build something? Is it something good and valuable? We have just one life. Let's not waste it on things not worth it. Let's make something that brings us some joy or help us in any way. Let's make it for others too. Let's make something we could be proud of and have some fun building it. We don't want to waste our time to build another dating site and help guys cheating their wives, right?
