  <h1 class="py-3">How to sell.</h1>
  <p class="text-info"><small>I wrote this for myself. I am not going to pretend to be an expert on the subject. I am not rich, but I highly appreciate independence and financial freedom, which is why I am trying to find answers to key questions. Writing helps me to concretize my thoughts and gather observations into a logical whole - the path. I hope it can help you too. This piece is more personal than others. I write in first person prespective and I'm addressing you directly. It's because I could explain it better than on my own example. You shouldn't feel that I try to instruct you. I just couldn't find better way to express my thoughs.</small></p>
  <p>I truly believe there’s only one rule. People need to eager to buy the thing you sell before they even get to know you exist and you sell your thing. They’ll buy your thing in a matter of seconds once they find it and believe the thing is what they’d been eager to have. I was wondering how to sell for years. I’ve been a salesman for almost twenty years and never been convinced what was the pattern that works for me for all these years. Then it hit me few weeks ago and I found that it suits to almost every single sale I made. It suits even to all the hard talks and moments with my kids. Why I was wondering what’s in clients minds though I was sitting in client mind for all this time. The key thing was to understand why I buy instead to try to figure what could all these clients convince to buy thing I was selling.</p>

  <p>I buy two kinds of things. The things that I need and the things that I want.  I buy thing that I need because I have no choice. The gasoline is the thing that I have to buy. I paid for it yesterday. I don’t like but I spent money on it. I won’t buy gasoline anymore once I get an electric car.</p>

  <p>What the things I bought lately just because I wanted?</p>
  <p>1. Athlean-X training program on Athleanx.com by Jeff Cavaliere.</p>
  <p>2. Crushing it! The book by Gary Vaynerchuk.</p>
  <p>3. Spathiphyllum wallisii flower.</p>
  <p>4. A cornbread.</p>

  <p>I want to look good. I want it for loooong time. I tried different things. Most of them didn’t work for me. I found Jeff Cavaliere’s ATHLEAN-X videos on youtube by accident. He convinced me he knows what he’s talking about. I believed him he can help me to look good. I visited his web site and bought a training program.</p>

  <p>I found Gary Vaynerchuk videos on youtube by accident too. He entertained me at first, I liked him, I like the entrepreneur things he’s talking about. I like it for over 20 years. I studied it, I read a lot about it, I run my business for 15 years. He convinced me once I found he made 200 mln USD.  Then I found he wrote a book which can help me to find clients for my new business, so I bought it. I bought I even in pre-sale.</p>

  <p>Now I know it wasn’t accident that I found Jeff Cavaliere’s videos neither it was with Gary Vaynerchuk videos. There was no accident in it at all. Not because of fate. I found it because I click things like that, I read about these things, I search it. I do it because I wanted to look good long before, I was curious how to find clients long before. I was ready to buy the things long before I knew about Jeff and Gary. I was eager to it. They just kind made a promise they fulfill it. The dream could be wrong word here. It sounds like too big word but I can’t find any better word so I’ll call it like that. I dream to look good and Jeff Cavaliere promissed me to fulfill that dream. I dream of wealthy and Gary Vaynerchuk promissed me to fulfill that dream.</p>

  <p>What about Spathiphyllum wallisii flower? It cleans the air in the office. I worked in an office with very bad air for 12 years. I didn’t know it for long time the air wasn’t clean. I got allergy three years ago but didn’t know it. I though I’m just sick. I was surprised when I realized once I feel sick for almost a year. Doc said it allergy. I took drugs for another year but it didn’t help. Worse. I couldn’t concentrate at work I feel sick more and more. I changed the office and felt much better after just three weeks. I dream to recover as fast as possible. It wasn’t accident I found Spathiphyllum wallisii flower can help me with that. I bought it immediately I found about it.</p>

  <p>A cornbread? I read a William Davis book about wheat. I got a bit scare of wheat. I was ready to not to eat wheat at all after I read the book but it’s hard. I found cornbread by accident;) I was so happy I can buy cornbread I didn’t not even ask for the price.</p>

  <p>The most important thing goes here. I would buy all these four things once again. I still trust Jeff Cavaliere and Gary Vaynerchuk. They didn’t lie,. The training program is really great and the book is reeeeeally helpful. I still believe the flower has the power, and I’m still scared of wheat and want to substitute it.</p>

  <p>People dream about different things. Try to answer to one of these dreams. Find a way to let people know about you and your “promise” how to fulfill their dream. Spread the vision like Jeff and Gary did. Spread the vision of good look. Spread the vision of lot of new clients. People talk about their dreams, read about their dreams, search how other people fulfilled their dreams, etc. Just answer. But answer in a way they want to listein. You need to put that answer in a form and channel they like and use. Convince them.  You need to be reliable, they need to believe you. Maybe the best way is to say „I’ve done it by myself and it works for me, I told other and it worked for them too. I’ll give you money back if it won’t work for you”. Don’t lie or you’re finished soon or later. Find a way to deliver the thing as easy as possible. It was extremely easy and quick to buy online training program or ebook.</p>
